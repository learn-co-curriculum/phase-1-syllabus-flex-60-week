# Phase 1 Syllabus: Flex Program, 20 Week Pace

## Learning Objectives

Welcome to Phase 1! In this phase, you'll learn the fundamentals of JavaScript
and how to create a single-page application. By the end of the phase, you will
be able to:

- Understand the fundamentals of JavaScript as a language, including functions
  and scope
- Use data type and structures to solve problems in JavaScript
- Identify and resolve bugs in code
- Manipulate web pages using the DOM
- Use asynchronous JavaScript to retrieve data

Use the schedule below to make sure you're working through the material at
the right pace. The lessons marked with a ⭐️ are **milestones** that are useful
to check your understanding of the material you've learned. If you feel you're
falling behind, make sure to communicate with your instructor.

## Week 1

This week, you'll learn the fundamentals of programming through JavaScript,
focusing on writing **functions** and working with **arrays** and **objects**.
There are a good amount of lessons to complete, but many of these review the
same concepts you explored in the prework.

**Total Assignments: (49)**

- Welcome to Phase 1 (2)
- JavaScript Fundamentals (9)
  - ⭐️ Quiz: JS Fundamentals
- Functions in JavaScript (8)
  - ⭐️ Quiz: Functions in JS
- Scope (5)
  - ⭐️ Quiz: Scope
- Working with Data Structures in JavaScript (23)
  - ⭐️ Quiz: Working with Arrays in JS
  - ⭐️ Quiz: Working with Objects in JS
- JavaScript Advanced Syntax (2)

## Week 2

After learning how to use JavaScript as a language, you'll get to put it to
practical use by using JavaScript to create interactive webpages. This week
introduces the "three pillars" of JavaScript that let you build a single-page
application: **DOM Manipulation** (modifying the structure of the page in JS),
**Event Handling** (writing JS to respond to user events, like clicking or
typing on the page), and **Network Communication** (using JS to access data from
a remote data source, like a web API).

**Total Assignments: (26)**

- Introducing Flatiron's Three Pillars of JavaScript (2)
- JS and the DOM (8)
  - ⭐️ Quiz: JS and The DOM
- JavaScript Events (7)
  - ⭐️ Challenge: TaskLister Mini-Project
  - ⭐️ Quiz: JS Events
- Communicating with the Server (9)

  - ⭐️ Additional Practice: Fetch Dog CEO (in _Additional Practice_ module)

## Week 3

This week, you'll finish learning about the "three pillars" of JavaScript.
You'll explore some more advanced concepts like **context**, **object
orientation**, and **inheritance** that will give you tools to write more
expressive programs and understand the language at a deeper level. You'll also
start prepping for your first project by working on some smaller practice
exercises to get practice working common features of on single-page
applications.

**Total Assignments: (19 plus optionals)**

- Combining the Three Pillars (2)
  - ⭐️ Additional Practice: Toy Tale (in _Additional Practice_ module)
- Context in JavaScript (7)
  - ⭐️ Quiz: Context in JavaScript
- Object-Oriented JavaScript (13 - optional)
  - ⭐️ Quiz: Object-Oriented JavaScript (optional)
- JavaScript Inheritance (6 - optional)
- Additional Practice: JS Projects (6)
- JS Project Prep
- Additional Practice: HTML Forms and Modern Elements (8 - optional)

## Week 4

Project time! This week, you'll be building a JavaScript project using all the
tools you've learned since starting this phase. The project is your chance to
solidify your understanding of the material, and to get creative and expand your
horizons.

Details for the project can be found in the Milestones module.
